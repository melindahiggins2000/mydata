```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE,
                      error= TRUE,
                      message = FALSE,
                      warning = FALSE)
```

## Load Data

Read in the CSV file using the `readr` package

```{r}
library(readr)
mydata <- read_csv("mydata.csv")
```

## Take a look at the dataset

Type `View(mydata)` at the prompt or run interactively from an R script or Rmarkdown document.

I will also be handing out a hard copy of these data so you can look at the data, the values and any patterns that emerge.

```{r eval=FALSE}
View(mydata)
```

## Also take a look at the "codebook"
